Drought prediction is of critical importance to early warning for drought managements. 
This work provides a synthesis of drought prediction based on statistical, dynamical, and 
hybrid methods. Statistical drought prediction is achieved by modeling the relationship 
between drought indices of interest and a suite of potential predictors, including large‚Äêscale 
climate indices, local climate variables, and land initial conditions.
SVM model has been applied for classification of real time data obtained from 
Meteorological department. Here we considered parameters like maximum rainfall, 
minimum rainfall and precipitation. The prediction is base on the dataset collected for a 
period of ten years over a region.
